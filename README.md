# C++ Dapper Dasher

This is a simple run n' jump game written in C++ using the Raylib GUI library. This was an exercise followed from the Udemy course: [C++ Fundamentals: Game Programming For Beginners](https://www.udemy.com/course/cpp-fundamentals).

Concepts learned:
* Creating and opening a window
* Using a game loop for game logic
* Rendering and animating sprites using a spritesheet
* Implementing gravity and character jumping
* Rendering text to screen for win / lose scenarios
* Using delta time to render graphics independent of frame rate
